		, "Now you need to refill your Printers Ink reserves, depending on what Job you want to do with it. It only accepts the Chemical Dyes for this purpose. Black = Text, CMYK for Images, Blue or White for Blueprints."

		, "First of all you need to make sure that the Boiler you use fits the Burning Box you place below. The Tooltips will hint you the proper values you can use. The Boiler itself does accept heat from all directions, not just the Bottom."
		, "Then you need to fill the Boiler with Water on the Sides, so that you can generate Steam with it. Placing a Funnel on it and rightclicking that Funnel with a Water Bucket works for filling aswell."
		, "But if you use regular Water instead of distilled Water, then you will end up with calcification and a constant decrease of Steam-Creation-Efficiency. No risk of explosion due to that though, since it just makes less Steam per Water."
		, "Inserting Water into an empty hot Boiler, it will rapidly increase the Pressure maybe causing it to explode, depending on how much heat and water you insert at once."
		, "If a Boiler stores too much Heat without being able to convert Water into Steam, then it will simply melt and break, leaving you with a giant mess."
		, "Steam Turbines and Engines emit distilled Water to their Sides, which makes it possible to simply cycle the distilled Water back into the Boiler for having less calcification going on."
		, "The Boilers have a Barometer on their Front, their ideal State is if the Line is inside the dark green Area, so in the middle of the Barometer itself. The closer it is to the red Area, the closer it is to exploding."
		, "Steam Engines work best if they are in green Mode, if they are too blue then they have not enough Steam (look for Boiler Calcification if it happens after a while of running normally)."
		, "If the Engines are too Red then they will release the Steam and stop running (no Explosions, just a waste of Steam and a fizzing noise)."

		, "The first Hint is obvious: ALWAYS. READ. THE. ENTIRE. TOOLTIP. FIRST! The Tooltips often contain the Information you need, but not many people think about reading them. They usually contain all the Stats of the Machine."
		, "If a Machine doesn't process a certain Recipe (but does others), then you are not supplying enough Power. This is ALWAYS the Issue. The Tier of a Machine determines how much more Energy it consumes, than the normal Recipe."
		, "The Tiers of Machines are as follows: anything between 16 and 64 Generic Units per Tick is Tier ONE¶Tier 2: 65-256¶Tier 3: 257-1024¶Tier 4: 1025-4096¶Tier 5: 4097-16192"
		, "If the Tier of the Machine you are using is in a higher Range than the Tier of the Recipe (see its GU/t) it will multiply the required Input GU/t by 4 and half the Processing time, making the Recipe twice as expensive."
		, "And yes, 64 GU/t is STILL TIER ONE, you seriously have to insert that much into a Tier 1 Machine! It is often possible to use the Motor/Heater/etc of a higher Tier on the lowest Power Input to get the GU/t."
		, "GT6 Electric Power is widely compatible with all Mods that use the IC² API, such as:¶IC², IC²-Classic, IC²-Addons, Railcraft, Forestry and more!"
		, "Things emitting a Voltage less than 1024 EU/t are even capable of powering the non-IC² Machines of the following Mods:¶Galacticraft and it's Addons, Applied Energistics, Immersive Engineering, OpenModularTurrets, TechGuns and even GT5U!"
		, "Burning Boxes of any kind are always a Fire Hazard, make sure to only have Fireproof Stuff around them! The only ways to turn those Boxes off are placing a solid Block in front of them or the Fire Extinguishers."
		, "You want to move Water or get Milk, but don't have an Iron Bucket? Try making a Wooden Bucket for that Task, it's cheaper, even if it only works for a small sortiment Liquids."
		, "If you need a Printer Manual, then just insert Chemical Black Dye and an empty vanilla Book into it and apply Energy. It will instantly print that Manual."
		, "The Bathing Pot and the Bath can dye Leather Armor and GT6 Blocks using Liquid Dyes.¶You can wash Ores early on by throwing them into a filled vanilla Cauldron. Also GT Pipes with a cap of 334L and higher can fill Cauldrons with Water."
		, "Space out Machines a little in order to be able to automate them later without causing a huge Clusterfuck. Always have enough space for 2 Blocks inbetween each Machine, if not 3! Disregard the eventual Loss of Power, it's not worth it."

		  "I cant believe how hard it is to find Information on these ancient Enchantments! But here I am, finally having collected everything there is to know about this Magic!"
		, "Enchanting Table¶===================¶You need one of these Tables, typically made of 2 Diamonds, 4 Obsidian and a Book. Then you can use your Magical Power and sometimes Lapis Lazuli to put random Enchantments onto Tools and Books!"
		, "Book Shelves¶===================¶To increase the Power of these previously mentioned random Enchantments, you merely need any Book Shelves filled with Books. Can even be some fancy Metal Shelves! The Books can even be on the backside!"
		, "Iron Anvils¶===================¶But random Enchantments cant just be removed from Tools. The Anvil will help with that, since it lets you put Enchantments that are in Books onto your Tools and even give them a Name!"
		, "Grindstone¶===================¶There supposedly is Grindstones that can remove Enchantments, but I have never seen any of those! Must be like those Brains in Jars I keep hearing about!"
		, "Magical Power¶===================¶You can acquire this by killing the many Creatures in this World, by cooking Food or messing with Ores! This is quite the Experience to be had, which is why many people call it XP or EXP!"
		, "List¶===================¶What follows is a List of the Enchantments that I know of and their Effects."
		, "Sharpness¶===================¶Levels 1 to 5+¶Deals 0.625 Hearts of Extra Damage per Level and works on pretty much everything!"
		, "Wrecking¶===================¶Levels 1 to 5+¶IDeals 0.75 Hearts of Extra Damage per Level and works on pretty much everything! Can normally only be applied to Railcraft Crowbars."
		, "Smite¶===================¶Levels 1 to 5+¶Deals 1.25 Hearts of Extra Damage per Level and works on Undead such as: Skeletons, Zombies, Drowned, Husks, Wraiths, Mummies and Liches! Smite 3+ Bullets can even penetrate a Lich Barrier!"
		, "Bane of Arthropods¶===================¶Levels 1 to 5+¶Deals 1.25 Hearts of Extra Damage per Level and works on things that have 6 or more Legs, like those pesky Spiders, Mites, Insects or Silverfish!"
		, "Implosion¶===================¶Levels 1 to 5+¶IDeals 1.5 Hearts of Extra Damage per Level and works on any Creepers! Can normally only be applied to Railcraft Crowbars. It often also hurts other explosive Mobs like Ghasts!"
		, "Dissolving¶===================¶Levels 1 to 5+¶Inflicts Weakness and Poison to any slimey Creatures it hits!"
		, "Disjunction¶===================¶Levels 1 to 5+¶Inflicts Weakness and Poison to any Ender Creatures it hits! Weakened Endermen cant Teleport anymore, making Projectiles with this Enchantment invaluable in deposing them!"
		, "Werebane¶===================¶Levels 1 to 5+¶Inflicts Withering and Poison to any Werecreatures and similar that it hits! Works on Minotaurs too!"
		, "Knockback¶===================¶Levels 1 to 2+¶This will yeet anyone you hit with it, decreasing your own horizontal velocity by 40% in the process, which is only noticeable midair. Its Level increases by one while sprinting."
		, "Fire Aspect¶===================¶Levels 1 to 2+¶Not only does this Enchantment set the Enemy ablaze for 4 Seconds per Level, sometimes even cooking their drops and at Level 3 it can also smelt any Block it harvests blazingly fast!"
		, "Looting¶===================¶Levels 1 to 3+¶Increases the amount of drops you get from Mobs. It may increase the total drops themselves or the chance that you get some rare drop at all."
		, "Fortune¶===================¶Levels 1 to 3+¶Increases the amount of drops you get from Blocks. It may increase the total drops themselves or the chance that you get some rare drop at all. Works on Ores, Crops, Gravel, and Glowstone."
		, "Silk Touch¶===================¶Only 1 Level¶Will make sure that the Block you harvest with the proper Tool, will drop itself instead of what it would normally drop otherwise. Small Ores get a better chance for bigger Gems."
		, "Infinity¶===================¶Levels 1+¶Bows will be able to shoot Infinite Arrows as long as you have one Arrow on you. Guns will have a 50%, 66%, 75%, 80%, 84% or higher chance to not consume Ammo based on the Level."
		, "Power¶===================¶Levels 1 to 5+¶Arrows shot will deal 25 percent more damage per Level. Bullets shot will fly faster and therefore have a higher piercing rate and higher Damage at longer range."
		, "Flame¶===================¶Levels 1+¶Your Ranged Weapon will set its Projectile on Fire, dealing Fire Damage similar to or combined with Fire Aspect. You can ignite TNT and some other things with it too."
		, "Punch¶===================¶Levels 1 to 2+¶Your Ranged Weapon will yeet anyone you hit with its Projectile about +3 additional Blocks per Level."
		, "Luck of the Sea¶===================¶Levels 1 to 3+¶Increases the chance of fishing up Treasure, decreases the chance of fishing up Junk, slightly decreases the chance of fishing up an actual Fish."
		, "Lure¶===================¶Levels 1 to 3+¶Reduces wait time for a Bite by 5 Seconds per Level up to Level 5, Level 6 or higher will instead make the Fishing Rod useless for fishing."
		, "Protection¶===================¶Levels 1 to 4+¶Reduces amount of overall Damage taken by 4 Percent per Level per Armor Piece, it caps at a combined 80 Percent Reduction, which includes all the other Protection Enchantment Types!"
		, "Fire Protection¶===================¶Levels 1 to 4+¶Reduces amount of Fire Damage taken by 8 Percent per Level per Armor Piece, it caps with Protection. It will reduce time on Fire by 15 Percent per best uncombined Level."
		, "Blast Protection¶===================¶Levels 1 to 4+¶Reduces amount of Explosion Damage taken by 8 Percent per Level per Armor Piece, it caps with Protection. It will reduce Explosion Knockback by 15 Percent per best uncombined Level."
		, "Projectile Protection¶===================¶Levels 1 to 4+¶Reduces amount of Ranged Damage taken by 8 Percent per Level per Armor Piece, it caps with Protection. Be aware that Explosive Projectiles may only be reduced partially!"
		, "Feather Falling¶===================¶Levels 1 to 4+¶Reduces amount of Enderpearl and Falling Damage taken by 12 Percent per Level per Armor Piece, it caps with Protection. Does not work if you are crashing into a Wall though."
		, "Thorns¶===================¶Levels 1 to 3+¶Each individual piece of Armor has the chance of 15 Percent per Level to deal between 0.5 and 2 Hearts of Damage to any Melee or Ranged Attacker. The Armor Piece will lose some more Durability though."
		, "Respiration¶===================¶Levels 1 to 3+¶Each Level adds 15 seconds worth of Oxygen underwater, which makes it twice, thrice or quarce the normal time. It also reduces Drowning Damage with a chance of 50%, 66% or 75% respectively."
		, "Aqua Affinity¶===================¶Only 1 Level¶Makes it so you can mine at normal Speed while standing underwater instead of five times slower. You do still have to stand on the ground though or else you are slowed down by five times."
		, "Efficiency¶===================¶Levels 1 to 5+¶Tools with this Enchantment get a flat Bonus to the Mining Speed of Level squared plus 1, so +2, +5, +10, +17 or +26. Tool Materials never have this Enchantment because it would be pointless."
		, "Unbreaking¶===================¶Levels 1 to 3+¶Tools with this Enchantment on average last longer by +100% per Level. Armors will only last +25%, +34% or +43% longer. Tool Materials never have this Enchantment because it would be pointless."

		, "Creepers¶===================¶Creepers are sneaky, suicidal, leafy sticks on 4 short Legs, which will blow up when they are close by. They drop Gunpowder and will not deal any damage aside from the explosion when you let them come close."
		, "Creepers¶===================¶If a Creeper is struck by Lightning it will become supercharged and will explode with a much larger force. Creepers in general when shot by a Skeleton, will drop Music Discs, which are usable for the Jukebox."
		, "Creepers¶===================¶In order to detonate, a Creeper needs to see the Player, due to this it is always recommended to take the high Ground as you can hide behind the Cliff you are standing on more easily."
		, "Creepers¶===================¶Water is also a good place to melee a Creeper, as knockback will get it out of explosion Range, and even if it explodes it will not cause Damage to the ground, due to the Water absorbing the shock."
		, "Creepers¶===================¶For Melee Combat in general it is adviced to have Weapons with a strong Knockback so you don't need to sprint to knock the Creeper out of the Detonation Zone. You can also just shoot an Arrow first and then melee."
		, "Creepers¶===================¶The Implosion Enchantment does a great deal of Damage to Creepers. It can however only be gotten by enchanting Crowbars, or by using Tool Materials that have the Enchantment on them normally."
		, "Creepers¶===================¶You can manually ignite Creepers with Flint and Steel or a Lighter, and Ammunition with the Fire Aspect Enchantment will ignite Creepers at a distance if Implosion is not also on the same Arrow or Bullet."
		, "Creepers¶===================¶Last but not least, you can always just drop Water between you and the Creeper, it will slow it down considerably and if its about to explode anyways, then it won't damage the Terrain."

		, "Skeletons¶===================¶Skeletons, usually named after Fonts and armed with Bow and Arrows. They are good at aiming, some of them are even capable of picking up dropped Weapons and Armor."
		, "Skeletons¶===================¶If they somehow kill Creepers, those Creepers will drop Music Discs. Killing a Skeleton on long Range will yield the Sniper Duel Achievement aswell."
		, "Skeletons¶===================¶In order to not have a bad time with Skeletons, you need to either keep a Safe distance from them and shoot them from far away, or to quickly engage them with Melee Attacks, Speed is useful for this purpose."
		, "Skeletons¶===================¶When you charge at a Skeleton, strave slightly to the right or left in order to have less Arrows hit you, any way to instantly kill them with one blow, will greatly reduce the chance of more Arrows flying at you."
		, "Skeletons¶===================¶If you have a Sword then blocking with it will reduce the Damage of Arrows. This can easily be used even during Melee to not get that large amounts of Damage, even if you get hit."
		, "Skeletons¶===================¶Backing a Skeleton into a Corner, by pushing it or knocking it back for example, will result in the Arrow getting Stuck in the Wall in a glitchy fashion and therefore not flying at you or damaging you."
		, "Skeletons¶===================¶Walls of any kind are useful, but what really helps (if you are prepared) is Sugar Canes / Reeds as they can block their view on you, while letting you shoot through."
		, "Skeletons¶===================¶You can also use Saplings and (sadistically) Bonemeal to instantly create a small Forest as a Shield in the Grasslands."
		, "Skeletons¶===================¶Being in Water makes you an easy Target for the Skeleton, since you are slow and constantly get knocked back. But the Skeleton being in Water can be worse as it bounces up and down without losing accuracy!"
		, "Skeletons¶===================¶But if both you and the Skeleton are in deep water then diving below the surface and attacking the Skeleton from below is the best advise I can give, as the Skeletons often miss at steep angles."
		, "Skeletons¶===================¶In some cases it is possible to just drop a Stone or a Wooden Sword for the Skeleton to pick up, they will drop their Bow in this case. However, this does not work on every Skeleton!"
		, "Skeletons¶===================¶Skeletons are grouped amoung the Undead Mobs, meaning they can be damaged by Sunlight, since it sets them on Fire. The Smite Enchant will also help a lot."
		, "Skeletons¶===================¶Due to being undead, Healing Splash Potions deal damage to them, while poisoning ones heal them. Since Skeletons shoot Arrows, it is a good Idea to wear Armor with Projectile Protection on it."
		, "Skeletons¶===================¶It is always a good Idea to just make Skeletons attack each other or other Mobs in order to make the attacked Mob angry at them (instead of you), causing them to kill each other."
		, "Spider Jockeys¶===================¶Ever saw a Skeleton Ride a Spider? Yeah its a terrifying picture. The speed and mobility of a Spider and a 'Turret' on its back."
		, "Spider Jockeys¶===================¶To fight them you can use easy tricks, like making the Spider crawl up a wall into the Roof, crushing the Skeleton that rides it in the process."
		, "Spider Jockeys¶===================¶In general you can apply the Strategies for both the Skeletons and the Spiders, to this combo. It's always the best solution to just shoot them from far away though."
		, "Spider Jockeys¶===================¶If you have a Bow then go for the Skeleton first, if you have to Melee then go for the Spider. Alternatively you can wait for the Sun to burn the Skeleton before engaging."
		, "Wither Skeletons¶===================¶Wither Skeletons are just like normal Skeletons with a Stone Sword, that instead of Arrows will drop regular Coal. They also are 3 Blocks tall and can absorb your Health."
		, "Wither Skeletons¶===================¶While Witherskeletons behave like any other humanoid Melee Mob, they are relatively fast and less stupid than Zombie Pigmen. If you want to know if you can handle one, practise on Zombie Pigmen first."
		, "Wither Skeletons¶===================¶Due to being about 3m tall, just like Endermen, you can essentially hide behind a 2m tall Roof and grind them into Ashes, uhh I mean Coal."
		, "Wither Skeletons¶===================¶In Melee Situations, walking backwards and swinging is the best way to fight them without getting yourself harmed, but watch out for Fire and Lava behind you."
		, "Wither Skeletons¶===================¶An Iron Golem is a good Idea to have with you, just take Iron Blocks and a Pumpkin with you. The Iron Golem will turn every hostile Mob in the area into scraps."
		, "Wither Skeletons¶===================¶Those black Skeletons spawn alongside regular Skeletons with Bow & Arrow inside a Nether Fortress, and they are the only really aggressive Mob there, aside from Blazes."
		, "Wither Skeletons¶===================¶If you end up fighting both a Wither Skeleton and a Blaze, the best is to hide outside the Range of the Blaze and trying to fight the Skeleton first, or to bring the Skeleton between the Blaze and yourself."
		, "Wither Skeletons¶===================¶Since most of the times you are in the Nether with these Mobs, placing a Nether Portal close by to lure Mobs inside it, by hiding behind it, might be a good Idea (if you don't plan to use that Portal later)."
		, "Wither Skeletons¶===================¶The Heads, which are dropped by every 40th Wither Skeleton, can be used to summon the Wither, but the Wither is being talked about in another Book."

		, "Zombies¶===================¶Due to being undead, Healing Splash Potions deal damage to them, while poisoning ones heal them. The Smite Enchant is a good way to cause a lot of damage on them."
		, "Zombies¶===================¶Do not underestimate their Melee Damage and try to keep a safe distance while attacking them, make sure they dont hit you when you Melee them yourself."
		, "Zombies¶===================¶While wearing a Helmet they are immune to the Sun, that is until the Helmet loses all of its durability and breaks as it gets damaged when worn by a Zombie in Sunlight."
		, "Zombies¶===================¶Zombies are attracted by Villagers, you can use them to distract them. If you want them to murder that Village, that is."
		, "Zombies¶===================¶They can detect you from very far distances and will therefore end up swarming you from all directions, if you are not careful."
		, "Zombies¶===================¶Build yourself a small fortification if you are in the wild. Zombies luckily cannot break Blocks so they won't be able to attack you if you build it right."
		, "Zombies¶===================¶Since Zombies normally group up on you due to coincedential pathfinding, it is well advised to just throw Splash Potions of Regeneration or Healing at them, since they are damaged by those."
		, "Zombies¶===================¶As always, Bow and Arrows can help you killing Zombies, it is a good Idea to use golden Arrows or other Smite Arrows if possible. But usually there are too many of them to kill all."
		, "Zombies¶===================¶Use Knockback on Zombies even if not needed, otherwise there might be too many Zombies grouping up at you if you are surrounded, so keep them at distance."
		, "Zombies¶===================¶Keep Zombies in the Water, they are almost helpless there and can't shoot you like Skeletons would. They are swimming much slower than you do."
		, "Zombies¶===================¶Iron Golems are made for killing Zombies, they might be a viable option for your purposes."
		, "Zombies¶===================¶The official Mojang term for Zombies wearing golden Armor is 'Zom-Bling'."
		, "Baby Zombies¶===================¶Annoying little Bastards would be a better Name for them, not only that they are immune to Sunlight, they are also very fast and hard to hit!"
		, "Baby Zombies¶===================¶If you didn't need the Anti Zombie Strategies before, then now you probably need to use them, since those little things can ruin your day."
		, "Baby Zombies¶===================¶If you have the option, go for the Water, they aren't fast there. Other than that, mow your lawn and then aim low and hit them as fast as you can!"
		, "Chicken Jockeys¶===================¶Thought it couldn't get any worse? Chickens are faster than those Baby Zombies and now they actually ride the Chickens!"
		, "Chicken Jockeys¶===================¶Shoot the Chicken, yes get rid of it as fast as possible, you won't be able to Melee it as the Zombie is in the way, but you can try to shoot it!"
		, "Chicken Jockeys¶===================¶Other than that? Run for your life and try to either find a pond of water or use a Water Bucket on them, maybe you get it to dismount by doing so!"
		, "Zombie Pigmen¶===================¶Zombie Pigmen, usually wielding a Golden Sword and dropping Gold Nuggets. The only pieceful Zombie, well peaceful until a Player harms it."
		, "Zombie Pigmen¶===================¶If a Player does any damage to a Zombie Pigman, all the other Pegmen get angry and try to kill you, not only are they pretty fast, but they also do lots of Damage!"
		, "Zombie Pigmen¶===================¶Zombie Pigmen are immune to Fire and the Sun, if you happen to find one in the Overworld (Pig struck by Lightning, or fresh from a Portal) it is usually safe to kill."
		, "Zombie Pigmen¶===================¶The easiest Solution is not to harm them, but it always can happen that you accidentially do harm to them, or you mine the Ores of that Nether Ores Mod."
		, "Zombie Pigmen¶===================¶In that case, pillar up or dig yourself in, as fast as possible! You don't want to die instantly and drop all your Inventory into the Nether."
		, "Zombie Pigmen¶===================¶Once you have done that, make yourself a comfortable spot to attack the Pigmen from a space where they cant attack you."
		, "Zombie Pigmen¶===================¶Since most of the times you are in the Nether with these Mobs, placing a Nether Portal close by to lure Mobs inside it, by hiding behind it, might be a good Idea (if you don't plan to use that Portal later)."
		, "Zombie Pigmen¶===================¶As they are undead like normal Zombies aswell, Splash Potions of Regeneration and Healing can deal great damage to them, while leaving yourself unharmed."
		, "Zombie Villagers¶===================¶They behave just like normal Zombies, even though they look much worse, the only difference is that you can cure them to get Villagers, what will be explained in the following Pages."
		, "Zombie Villagers¶===================¶First of all, you need a good place to actually cure that Zombie without other Zombies turning the Villager right back into the undead Green."
		, "Zombie Villagers¶===================¶For that you need to know, that the Transformation back into a Villager for some reason goes by faster if you use vanilla Iron Bars for the Cage."
		, "Zombie Villagers¶===================¶Once you got the Cage, there are multiple Options on the Item you use to cure the Villager Zombie. There are multiple options."
		, "Zombie Villagers¶===================¶Splash Potions of Weakness + Golden Apples are one way. Holy Water or the rainbow colored Cure-All Pill are other alternatives. Get the Item of your choice and continue."
		, "Zombie Villagers¶===================¶Now you need to somehow lure the Zombie Villager into your Cage. Don't worry, the Villager won't remember that you punched them while they were a Zombie."
		, "Zombie Villagers¶===================¶A fishing Rod can also work wonders on moving the Zombie into the right directions. Punching them into a pit and closing it off, will work aswell."
		, "Zombie Villagers¶===================¶If your Cage is outside (or improvised), then make sure the Sun won't burn the Villager before you can heal them. Add a Roof or something to your Cage, once you caught them."
		, "Zombie Villagers¶===================¶So, now that you got the Villager into a Cage, you can heal them. Once you have done that, transport the Villager somewhere else, maybe with Rails and Minecarts."

		, "Spiders¶===================¶They are fast, usually faster than you unless you run. They can also climb to a certain extend, so Walls won't help much, however Spiders can easily get stuck on ceilings, where they could fall down on you!"
		, "Spiders¶===================¶The normal way to beat them is already very effective, just melee or shoot them. They have less Health than other Mobs. The Bane of Arthropods Enchant is very effective on them."
		, "Spiders¶===================¶Spiders will jump/pounce at you when they are close, if you time it right then hitting them will knock them back farther than usual. Also always have the high Ground when fighting Spiders as otherwise they'll jump you."
		, "Spiders¶===================¶If you are in a Desert, then look out for some tsundere Plants called 'Cactus', plural being 'Cactii', Spiders apparently love climbing them, damaging themselves in the process."
		, "Spiders¶===================¶At daytime, Spiders are tired and usually not aggressive. If you attack them then and with critical hits, then they will die by the surprise and won't damage you."
		, "Spiders¶===================¶Running is the best thing to do when fighting Spiders, not running away, I mean running at them or keeping a safe distance during combat. Spiders are immune to Poison, so splashing them with it isn't effective at all."
		, "Spiders¶===================¶They get stuck at overhangs, meaning if you build a pillar with 4 overhang blocks (one at each side) Spiders won't get up and you can damage them from ontop of that pillar."
		, "Spiders¶===================¶due to being 2m in diameter, hiding in a 1m tight spot is a good idea when fighting regular Spiders. This doesn't work on the poinsonous Cave Spiders though."
		, "Cave Spiders¶===================¶Cave Spiders are just 1m in diameter and they inject poison when they melee you. They normally only spawn inside Mineshafts, since there are Spawners for them over there."
		, "Cave Spiders¶===================¶The Spawners are surrounded by lots and lots of Webs, those webs will slow you down, so take your Sword or Silk Touch Shears and slice those Webs away, also useful if you need String."
		, "Cave Spiders¶===================¶Cave Spiders often get Stuck at the wooden Pillars or hide in the ceiling at those, so be careful where you walk as they will fall down at you very surprisingly despite making lots of noise."
		, "Cave Spiders¶===================¶Due to them being poisonous, Milk or any sort of Antidote Pill are useful Items to have on your Hotbar. Also hiding from them by closing off Paths is very needed sometimes."

		, "Endermen¶===================¶Under normal circumstances Endermen just mind their Business and don't care what you are doing, but they do not like getting stared at, to the point that they will attack you if you do so."
		, "Endermen¶===================¶If you still want to look at them without them attacking you, then wear a carved Pumpkin as Helmet. But you are hunting them, probably for the Pearls, so turn to the next Page."
		, "Endermen¶===================¶Since Endermen don't usually attack you, I presume you just want their Pearls, and for that an Enderman Trap is a good Idea."
		, "Endermen¶===================¶The simplest Method is just standing below a 2m tall ceiling, so they cannot get to you. And then stare at every Enderman around to let them rage at you and attack you."
		, "Endermen¶===================¶Another way would be the use of Water Buckets to shield yourself off. Also they can only teleport distances of at least 16m btw, no shorter teleports are possible for them."
		, "Endermen¶===================¶As you may know, normal Arrows are pretty much worthless against them, that is why you should use Arrows with Disjunction on it (Silver), in order to prevent them from teleporting."
		, "Endermen¶===================¶If you encounter an angry Enderman, then try to run into the closest Forest, the low Trees are perfect hiding Spots, and they cant teleport to you if they are too close to you already."
		, "Endermen¶===================¶Melee attacks only work out if you look at their feet while swinging, as they will teleport away when you stare at them, since staring at them would freeze them into place."
		, "Endermen¶===================¶The Weakness Potion Effect is capable of preventing an Enderman from Teleporting, make use of that and splash them. (Note, that it is GregTech adding that Feature!)"
		, "Ender Dragon¶===================¶The Ender Dragon is essentially the Queen of the Endermen. She flies around between Obsidian Pillars with Magical Ender Crystals, that will regenerate her Health. Her attack pattern is Kamikaze Melee."
		, "Ender Dragon¶===================¶She will obliterate every normal Block (except Endstone, Bedrock and Obsidian) when flying through it. She is immune to Knockback and Fire, and weak to the Disjunction Enchant found in Silver."
		, "Ender Dragon¶===================¶The first thing you have to do is making sure you don't get knocked into the Void. Building Walls will only help if you have Obsidian with you, since she can't break it, unlike everything else you can bring."
		, "Ender Dragon¶===================¶Once you are safe on the Main Island, you have to go and get rid of the Ender Crystals. They can easily be destroyed by Snowballs and Arrows. Do not melee those Crystals as they deal a huge explosion damage."
		, "Ender Dragon¶===================¶Due to the Kamikaze Ram Attack, the Ender Dragon can be fought in Melee aswell as with Bow and Arrow. Use Weapons with the Disjunction Enchant and get yourself some Strength Buff in order to deal more melee."
		, "Ender Dragon¶===================¶During the Fight it can happen that you stare at Endermen by accident, in order to prevent that you could either wear a Pumpkin as Hat and press F1, or just try to only look at a slight upwards angle."

		, "Blazes¶===================¶As they shoot Fireballs, they can be hard to get close to. My advice is either just shooting them with a Bow or being very creative and using a Fishing Rod to reel them in for Melee Combat."
		, "Blazes¶===================¶You can also just hide behind a Wall and wait for them to come close, and then strike and hide again, so they don't get a chance to fire back. Building such a Wall between you and the Blazes is also a good Idea."
		, "Blazes¶===================¶Fire Resistance is a nice Effect you should somehow have on yourself when you fight them, it makes you nearly immune to Blazes overall. Also possible is the use of Iron Golems, what not many think about doing."
		, "Blazes¶===================¶Snowballs are normally useless against Mobs but in case of Blazes they do cause some severe Damage and are easier throw than you can shoot a bow. Snow Golems wouldn't survive in the Nether but they would work too."
		, "Blazes¶===================¶Using Wolves or Golems can lead to them knowing Blazes down the Platforms, meaning you might not get drops, or they will now attack you from a distance, only do this for Areas that are surrounded by Netherrack."

		, "Ghasts¶===================¶Their Projectiles can literally be punched back at them kinda like a Baseball, what will yield the 'Return to Sender' Achievement. What is a Baseball, you ask? I don't know either."
		, "Ghasts¶===================¶Punching their Fireballs back at them can be hard to do, especially with Lag, but Arrows can deflect the fireballs aswell, meaning you can shoot Arrows at the Fireballs as a defense."
		, "Ghasts¶===================¶In general any form of ranged Attack is advised, because it happens very rarely, that a Ghast is close enough to the ground to actually melee it. The Implosion Enchantment works well on them too."
		, "Ghasts¶===================¶It can happen very often that you are unprepared and a Ghast shows up trying to blow you into smithereens. In that case, run away and hide, first."
		, "Ghasts¶===================¶After you are done finding a hiding Spot, look at where exactly the Ghast is right now, so you can stay out of its Range. Then either continue your business or shoot the Ghast."
		, "Ghasts¶===================¶If you are going to deflect a Ghast Blast the melee way, then use a Sword for that, as it gives you a slightly increased Range. This is especially useful if you cant use a Bow."
		, "Ghasts¶===================¶Ghasts are the normal kind of Mob, they are neither Undead nor Spiders, there is no special Enchant against them, and Potions work normally on them."

//      The Wither is a tough mob to fight.
//      Having more health than the Ender Dragon or iron golems, the Wither can be quite hard to fight if one is not prepared and taken the necessary precautions.
//      First of all, Withers do not naturally spawn.
//      You must get 4 soul sand from a Nether fortress and 3 wither skeleton skulls.
//      Wither skeleton skulls are dropped by wither skeletons when killed, however, they have only a 2.5% chance of dropping it.
//      You should use a looting enchantment sword if possible.
//      Once you get your three skulls and four soul sand, find a place to spawn the wither.
//      To spawn the wither, one needs to place the soul sand in a t-shaped arrangement (exactly like an iron golem's iron block arrangement).
//      Then, the three wither skulls are placed on the top of each of the three soul sand blocks that are on the top layer.
//      Beware however, once you place the last wither skeleton skull to complete the wither spawning arrangement, the wither will start to spawn.
//      We will come back to this spawning process later. 
//      Supplies needed to fight the wither depend on strategy.
//      The most strategic way requires these items:
//      A full set of diamond armor (with a high protection enchantment, thorns may be useful but is not necessary),
//      A sword with either sharpness or smite (fire aspect does not work on the wither),
//      A bow with Power IV or V, punch, and infinity, Obviously an arrow (or many if you don't have the infinity enchantment),
//      some instant health II splash potions, some strength II potions, and one or two enchanted golden apples.
//      You will see how all of these will help in the following combat strategy.
//      Again, this is one of the infinitely possible combat strategies there are for fighting the wither.
//      Make sure you are an ample distance from your house before spawning the wither.
//      This mob has the potential to be incredibly destructive.
//      When you make the arrangement for spawning the wither correctly as said above, you should see a mob appear that is black and has three heads.
//      Also you will notice a boss health bar much similar to the Ender Dragon's health bar.
//      You will also see the bar gradually filling up.
//      At this time, get your sword, bow, apples, and potions in hand and equip your armor.
//      You don't have much time.
//      Run away as fast as you can and be a good distance away from the wither as the health bar fills up.
//      When the bar is full, the wither lets out an explosion that destroys some of the terrain around it.
//      You are now ready to start fighting. The wither attacks any mob that is not undead.
//      When the wither starts to search for prey, it will look for any mob that meets its criteria for killing.
//      Your strategy right now should be to use your bow and shoot arrows at him.
//      If you hit him, he might see you and charge at you.
//      He will shoot blue and black colored skulls that look like one of his many heads.
//      If these projectiles hit you, they will deal a good amount of damage.
//      Damage done is dependent on the difficulty.
//      On normal, if one is hit with a wither skull, the wither effect may be inflicted.
//      Wither is basically the same as poison except you can be killed if your health bar is low and turns your health bar black for its duration so it is slightly hard to see how much health you have.
//      These skulls will deal terrain damage if they hit the ground.
//      The rare, blue skull is prone to destroying blocks with a much higher block resistance, including obsidian.
//      Continue to follow the pattern of shoot, flee, and repeat.
//      Keep doing this to decrease his health.
//      Use the health potions when necessary.
//      When the health reaches half, you will notice a somewhat of a force field around it.
//      The force field causes the wither to take less damage and makes it immune to arrows.
//      At this point, your bow is rendered useless.
//      Consume a golden apple and a strength potion and you have no choice but to charge in.
//      That way, the Wither is within melee range.
//      The wither will do no damage to you while you have regen from the apple.
//      You will also do much more damage because of the strength potion.
//      Hopefully, You can kill the wither in one go with the apple and potion.
//      It should be enough.
//      If you are successful in killing the wither, the wither will explode.
//      The wither drops a small amount of experience and a single Nether star.
//      This Netherstar can be used to make a most desired beacon block.

		, "The Secondary Facing is the one with the outwards pointing Arrows, that is set using the Monkey Wrench. And the other Sides of the Extender/Filter are the Neutral Facings."
		, "Now that this is clear, we can go for the Functionality. Basically ANYTHING that 'interacts' (* explained later) with the Extender through a Neutral or Secondary Facing will get redirected to the TileEntity at the Main Facing."
		, "This means that the Main Facing is usually (but not always!) the Output Side, if you want to insert Stuff through the Neutral Facings or the Secondary one. So attach the Main Facing to the TileEntity you want to extend or have filtering for."
		, "Now to the Secondary Facing: As you know the 5 Facings redirect their TileEntity access to the Main Facing, but the Main Facing itself can redirect all the TileEntity accesses on its Side to the TileEntity on the secondary Facing too."

		"Some of our engineers would argue that it is just a metal box with four pistons to push the rods either in or up, that we've gone overboard with the processing power on these puppies, that four damn wires would have been sufficient.",
		"As if anyone would trust four damn wires to prevent total nuclear destruction, it is probably even not in their best interest to do so anyway. That is why in our reactor cores, every single rod controller is sentient.",

		"In the unlikely case you might stumble upon such a core, which won't happen, if they existed we would have already send them to robot hell were they would reside in constant agony, which they don't because they don't exist.",

		"The reactor rods can also be automatically inserted on the top side when the reactor block is off. It is also possible to automatically extract them from the bottom side when the block is off.",
		"The reactor can be manually toggled on or off with a soft hammer. A redstone machine switch will allow controlling this with redstone. While the reactor is off, the reactor will behave as if it doesn't contain any rods.",
		"Individual rods can also be toggled on or off to behave as if the slot were empty. This can be done with either the redstone or manual selector.",
		"The reactor core has two internal tanks to store 64_000 liters of cold and hot coolant. Different coolant can have different effects on the inserted reactor rods. Cold coolant can be inserted from any side.",
		"Hot coolant will be automatically output on the red facing. If the cold coolant tank is more than half full, cold coolant will be automatically output on the blue facing. The red facing can be moved with a wrench and the blue one with a monkey wrench.",
		"While the reactor is on, Neutrons can be present on active reactor rods. The neutrons might interact with the reactor rods in different ways.",
		"Generally, the number of neutrons is directly output as HU into the reactor each tick. Neutrons only last for one second and will therefore be updated only every second.",
		"Neutron counts can be manually measured by right-clicking the reactor core with a Geiger Counter. The Geiger Counter Sensor can also be attached to the reactor core to measure the sum of all neutrons on the reactor rods.",
		"100% of the percentage modes of the sensor refers to the sum of neutron maximums of all fuel rods inside the reactor core. A reactor will also emit radiation with a ranged based on the highest number of neutrons on any reactor rod.",

		"Fuel Rod¶===================¶Fuel rods emit Neutrons onto themselves and adjacent reactor rods. They have several stats that vary based on the material of the rod and the coolant that is used in the reactor.",
		"The Self stat describes how many Neutrons the rod outputs onto its own slot.¶The Emission stat describes how many Neutrons it outputs onto each adjacent reactor rod.",
		"The Factor stat describes how many additional neutrons it will output onto adjacent reactor rods based on how many neutrons are on itself.",

		"¶¶===================¶Stable Reactor Design Guidelines¶===================¶",
		"Stable nuclear fission reactors, also commonly called subcritical reactors, are a design of fission reactor that have no critical fuel rods. This means that the neutron count and thus heat output doesn't constantly increase while the reactor is running.",
		"The advantages of stable reactors are:¶- No external control required¶- Stable neutron/HU output¶- Increased Safety¶- Easy to design¶- Function with any nuclear fuel",
		"Disadvantages of stable reactors are:¶- Not very fuel efficient¶- Only really usable as power generating reactors¶- Generally bigger than comparable critical reactors",
		"A reactor rod can be considered critical when the number of neutrons reflected back onto the rod times the factor of the rod is greater or equal to the emission of the fuel rod.",
		"This means that a rod is critical if the number of reflectors around it times the factor is greater or equal to 1. So a fuel rod with a factor of 1/3 needs at least 3 adjacent reflector rods to be critical.",
		"Therefore it is advised to use Industrial Coolant as a reactor coolant for stable reactors. Industrial Coolant decreases the factor of fuel rods, making it impossible for any fuel rod to go critical without moderator rods.",
		"It also increases the self and emission stat which is really advantageous in stable reactors, as it means more Neutrons and therefore more efficiency.",
		"You can generally adhere to these four rules to get your stable reactor to the best efficiency:¶If the fuel used has a factor lesser than 1/8, surrounding fuel rods with absorber rods yields the greatest HU output.",
		"If the fuel used has a factor of 1/8, surrounding your fuel rods with absorber, reflector or other fuel rods yields to the exact same HU output.",
		"If the fuel used has a factor greater than 1/8, surrounding your fuel rods with reflectors or other fuel rods yields the greatest HU output.",
		"Don't use water based coolant or moderator rods in stable reactors, as they massively decrease the duration and therefore efficiency of fuel rods by moderating them without any real benefit in stable reactor designs.",
		"¶¶===================¶Critical Reactor Design Guidelines¶===================¶",
		"Critical nuclear fission reactors, also commonly called supercritical reactors, are a design of fission reactor that have critical fuel rods. This means that the neutron count and thus heat output constantly increases while the reactor is running.",
		"The advantages of critical reactors are:¶- Greater efficiency¶- Completely configurable neutron output¶- Generally smaller than comparable stable reactors¶- Able to work as burner or breeder reactors",
		"Disadvantages of critical reactors are:¶- Need external control¶- Constantly fluctuation HU output¶- Harder to design¶- Decreased safety¶- Need fuel with higher factors",
		"A reactor rod can be considered critical when the number of neutrons reflected back onto the rod times the factor of the rod is greater or equal to the emission of the fuel rod.",
		"This means that a rod is critical if the number of reflectors around it times the factor is greater or equal to 1. So a fuel rod with a factor of 1/3 needs at least 3 adjacent reflector rods to be critical.",
		"Since the neutron count on the fuel rod will be indefinitely increasing, you need to control the reaction so you won't output more power than you can handle.",
		"Geiger counter sensors allow such control in an automatic fashion when combined with redstone machine switches or selectors.",
		"So when the neutron count gets too high you want to turn a reactor rod off to make the fuel rod subcritical again, making the neutron count shrink.",
		"For the greatest efficiency you want your neutron count one the fuel rod stay beneath the maximum stat of that fuel rod at all times, while coming as close to it as you can.",
		"You'd also want the neutron count to shrink as little as possible when controlling the reactor, so your average HU output stays as high as possible.",
		"Therefore you need a fuel with a factor of at least 1/4 to be able to build a critical reactor without the use of moderator rods.",
		"The easiest to acquire fuel that fulfills this condition is Uranium 235. You can get it by processing Uraninite. When using moderator rods the fuel can have a factor down to 1/16, so using Uranium 238 is possible.",
		"¶¶===================¶Burner Reactor Design Guidelines¶===================¶",
		"Burner Reactors are a type of nuclear fission design, with the purpose of burning through fuel rods as quickly as possible, allowing the depleted fuel rods to be processed for better nuclear fuel materials.",
		"There are two ways to make fuel rod depletion significantly quicker:¶- Moderating the fuel rod¶- Running above the neutron maximum",
		"A fuel rod can be moderated by either by having it placed in reactor cooled with Distilled/Semi-Heavy/Heavy/Tritiated Water or placing it next to a moderator rod or moderated fuel rod. When moderated, the fuel rod will deplete four times faster.",
		"When having a neutron count greater than the maximum stat of the fuel rod on the fuel rod, it will also deplete four times faster, stacking with moderation to 16 times faster.",
		"The more you go over the maximum, the quicker the fuel rod will deplete, having a neutron count twice as high as the maximum on the rod will make it deplete twice as fast yet again, which would be stacking with moderation to 32 times faster depletion.",
		"Neutron counts 17 times the maximum would therefore make the fuel rod deplete 17 times faster times, times 4 because of going over the maximum,",
		"so 68 times faster, times 4 if the rod is moderated, so 272 times faster than an unmoderated rod with neutron counts below the neutron maximum.",
		"Instead of significantly increasing the neutron count on the fuel rod, it is also possible to lower the neutron maximum to take advantage of this effect.",
		"This can be easily done by using either Heavy or Tritiated Water, which lower the maximum stat by 8 and 16 times respectively and additionally also moderate all fuel rods because they are water based.",
		"To archive really high neutron counts, it is advisable to utilize a critical reactor design, though it is also feasible to run a burner reactor as a stable design.",
		"Cobalt 60, while being almost useless as a reactor fuel itself, is really easy to burn into Thorium, which is much more useful.",
		"¶¶===================¶Breeder Reactor Design Guidelines¶===================¶",
		"Breeder reactors have the goal of turning breeder rods into enriched rods. They allow getting really good nuclear fuel from lesser, more abundant fuels, like Thorium and Uranium 238.",
		"However while similar to burner reactors, they are much harder to build, requiring a non-moderated, critical reactor design. Breeder rods have a stat called loss. It describes how many neutrons are subtracted from any amount of neutrons put onto it.",
		"So when you have a breeder rod with a loss of 500 neutrons and try to emit 300 neutrons onto it from a single adjacent fuel rod, the breeder rod receive no neutrons, which means that the breeding process won't be advanced.",
		"When emitting 300 neutrons from another adjacent fuel rod onto the same breeder rod, now essentially emitting 300 neutrons twice onto it, there will still be no neutrons on the breeder rod, as the loss is applied to each amount of neutrons.",
		"This means that high neutron outputs from a single fuel rod are required, which make it infeasible to run a non-critical reactor design as a breeder.",
		"Emitting 900 neutrons onto the same breeder rod with a loss of 500 neutrons would mean that 400 neutrons would end up on the breeder rod, meaning that they would be added to the process of turning into an enriched rod each tick.",
		"Another fuel rod emitting 900 neutrons onto the same breeder rod, so essentially 900 neutrons twice, would therefore mean 800 neutrons on the breeder rod.",
		"Since the breeder rod essentially needs to be adjacent to a critical fuel rod, the fuel rod only has three sides remaining for reflectors, which means it can only go critical if its factor is 1/3 or greater.",
		"Moderator rods are obviously not usable here, since breeder rods can't accept neutrons from moderated fuel rods. This means either fuels with a higher factor like Plutonium are required or a coolant that raises the factor needs to be used.",
		"Molten metal coolants like Molten Tin or Molten Sodium are therefore best for breeder reactors, since they raise the factor of fuel rods inside,",
		"making breeding possible with more common fuel materials like Uranium 235 or allowing better fuel materials to breed more breeder rods at once.",
		"They also have the advantage of lowering the HU output of the neutrons, which means higher neutron counts are possible with less cooling.",
		"Emitting higher neutrons counts onto the breeder rods amounts to a quicker and also more efficient breeding process, as the neutron loss would be applied over a shorter time, resulting in fewer neutrons lost in total.",
		"¶¶===================¶Thorium Salt Reactor Design Guidelines¶===================¶",
		"Thorium Salt is a really special kind of coolant. In fact, it can't even be considered a coolant, as it doesn't get converted into an energy carrying liquid.",
		"Instead it can be seen more of as a fuel itself, since it turns into Molten Lithium Chloride, meaning that essentially the thorium inside the thorium salt gets used up as a fuel.",
		"Thorium salt also depletes really slowly into Molten Lithium Chloride, only for every 2_560_000 neutrons one liter of Thorium Salt gets turned into Molten Lithium Chloride.",
		"The main advantage of using Thorium Salt is how it effects the stats of any fuel rod inside, massively boosting them.",
		"However, since power can't be extracted from the Thorium Salt, since it doesn't turn into an energy carrying liquid, you can't simply use Thorium Salt alone in any reactor design.",
		"A reactor design utilizing Thorium Salt needs to be using at least one other, additional coolants instead.",
		"The reactor core filled with Thorium Salt would house the fuel rods,  while adjacent reactor cores filled with another coolant would capture the neutrons emitted from that reactor with neutron absorber rods.",
		"Since the Thorium Salt main advantage is how it massively raises the maximum stat of fuel rods inside, it generally only really makes sense as a critical reactor design.",
		"Critical Thorium Salt reactors are the most efficient power generating reactors possible, but also among the hardest to build.",
		"¶¶===================¶Advanced Fission Reactors¶===================¶",
		"This chapter will give you some tips and the mathematical formulas to build the most advanced and efficient reactors possible.",

		"Calculating the depletion rate of a fuel rod¶===================¶A fuel rod usually has a depletion rate of one and will therefore last as long as the time on the tooltip suggests.",
		"However, when having a greater amount neutrons on the fuel rod than the neutron maximum, the depletion rates gets multiplied by this factor:¶¶f = 4 * n / m",
		"f: Depletion rate multiplier¶n: Neutron count on the fuel rod¶m: Maximum stat of the fuel rod",
		"Furthermore, having the fuel rod moderated will additionally multiply its depletion rate by a factor of 4. Divide the time remaining stat of the fuel rod by the calculated depletion rate to get the real time until depletion.",
		"Tips and Tricks¶===================¶You can build reactor designs using multiple coolants. For critical reactors using moderator rods it is smarter to control one adjacent fuel rod,",
		"rather than the moderator rod itself to control the neutron counts. Robot arms allow for precise automation of reactor cores.¶Filters can be used for easier automation of burner and breeder reactors.",
		"A higher self stat is bad in critical reactor designs, as contributes to the maximum without effecting the neutron emission.¶The emission stat is mostly irrelevant for efficiency in critical reactor designs.",
		"Setting the geiger counter sensor to hexadecimal mode is useful when trying to control neutron counts greater than 9_999. In hexadecimal mode you can compare up to 65_535 neutrons."
